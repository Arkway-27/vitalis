### Project Description

Elderly individuals often struggle to manage their health due to age-
related cognitive, physical, and technological limitations. This includes
challenges in scheduling appointments, understanding prescriptions,
managing medications, analyzing medical reports, maintaining fitness,
and responding to emergencies. Lack of integrated, accessible digital
support reduces their independence and increases caregiver burden.
